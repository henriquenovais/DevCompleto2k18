	<!-- To use an exterior file of style(most common usage of css):

	<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" > 
	It'll be a lot more easier because you can use the same style sheet on the many more webpages of that same domain -->

	<!-- Incorporated css will be restricted to one page only, the one page the has the CSS incorporated in its HTML file. In order to use that we have to use the <style></style> tag.

	<style>
	h1 {
	font-size: 200%
		
		}
	</style> -->

	<!-- The last way to use CSS is through inline CSS. Basically, the CSS will be restricted to one tag in the HTML file. A good example would be:
	 <h1 style="color:red"> Page tittle </h1>-->

	 <!--  http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work-en.html-->
	 <!-- http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2 -->

	 <!-- 
	This is a CSS bracket connected to a class: 
				
	.classname{
		
		} 


	-->

	<!-- This is a CSS bracket connected to multiple html tags(in this case the tags ul, li and a will have its letters in a different color):

	ul, li, a{
				color: lime;
			 } 
			 -->

			 <!-- This is a CSS bracket connected to an HTML tag through ID:
			 #idname {
		
			 } 
			 -->

			 <!-- The main difference between the usage of ID and CLASS specs is that id is unique while class can be applied to a group of tags -->

			 <!-- This CSS bracket is only applied to a certain combination of tags(<div><p>Only this kinda of text will have its color changed to lime</p></div>):
			 	div p{
					color: lime;
			 	}
			 -->

			 <!-- This CSS bracket has a very special use, the first type of tag will serve as a reference to the properties of the bracket since only the first element right after it will get the specified changes(only the first <a></a> tag after a <h1></h1> tag will have its letters changed):

			 	h1+a{
			 		color: lime;
			 	}

			 -->

			 <!--
			 	These two tags are perfectly possible:
				
				<label for="presshere">This button has two classes and an id: </label>
			 	<input id="presshere" class="red button" type="submit" value="Enter">  
			 -->

			 <!--
			 A possible styling bracket would be:

			 #highlight div p a {
				color: orange;
			 } 

			 In this case the web browser will first locate in the code the many <a></a> tags of your documents to then locate which one of these tags are <p><a></a></p> tags. After that, the web browser will locate which one of these <p><a></a></p> tags are 
			 <div><p><a></a></p></div>. At last, the browser shall look for the name of the id in the universe of <div><p><a></a></p></div> tags(it'll look for a <div><p><a id="highligh"></a></p></div>).
			 -->

			 <!-- It is not strange to find multiple types of CSS linked in a same HTML file. The order in which a browser reads these multiple types of CSS linking is:

			 1) external CSS  [<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" > ]

			 2) internal CSS  
			 [		<style>
				h1 {
					font-size: 200%
		
				}
			</style> --]

			 3) internal and HTML incorporated CSS [ <h1 style="color:red"> Page tittle </h1> ]


			 One more reason to always avoid internal incorporated CSS.

			<!-- System fonts are those embedded on the operating system thus these do not need to be loaded from any web source and the user of the web browser can see them perfectly fine without having to load more files.-->

			<!-- Web fonts are fonts which usage depends on a certain host - enabling this font to be used by another webpage. Web font resources are: 
		
			https://fonts.google.com
			https://www.fonts.com/
			https://edgewebfonts.adobe.com/

	<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway:400,700,700i" rel="stylesheet"> 
			<!-- It is very important to be careful when it comes to the amount of customization in a font, there are many options but these require more loading time for the webpage (weight and style specifications may vary from font to front, so there are many ways to use a same font-family)-->
	<style type="text/css">

		If the entire web page has the same design identity it is possible to do:;

		body{
			font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive;;
		}

		This will guarantee a cleaner code since there won't be spam of the font-family section. If you do as explained, it would be best not to specify the font size on this part[PROFESSOR ADVICE! WHY?].

		<h1>Now we shall learn CSS</h1>

		<p>This is a test BOYZ</p>

		<p> Ludwig von Mises was born to Jewish parents in the city of Lemberg, Galicia, Austria-Hungary (now Lviv, Ukraine). The family of his father Arthur Edler von Mises had been elevated to the Austrian nobility in the 19th century (Edler indicates a noble landless family); they had been involved in financing and constructing railroads. Ludwig's mother, Adele (née: Landau), was a niece of Dr. Joachim Landau, a Liberal Party deputy to the Austrian Parliament.[6]:3–9 Arthur von Mises was stationed in Lemberg as a construction engineer with the Czernowitz railway company.

		<p>By the age of twelve, Ludwig spoke fluent German, Polish and French, read Latin, and could understand Ukrainian.[7] Mises had a younger brother, Richard von Mises, who became a mathematician and a member of the Vienna Circle, and a probability theorist.[8] When Ludwig and Richard were still children, their family moved back to Vienna.[citation needed]</p>

		<p>In 1900, Ludwig Von Mises attended the University of Vienna,[9] becoming influenced by the works of Carl Menger. Mises' father died in 1903. Three years later, Mises was awarded his doctorate from the school of law in 1906.[10]</p>

		<p id="properties1">In the years from 1904 to 1914, Mises attended lectures given by Austrian economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk.[11] He graduated in February 1906 (Juris Doctor) and started a career as a civil servant in Austria's financial administration. </p>

		<p id="properties2">After a few months, he left to take a trainee position in a Vienna law firm. During that time, Mises began lecturing on economics, and in early 1909, he joined the Vienna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. During World War I, Mises served as a front officer in the Austro-Hungarian artillery and as an economic adviser to the War Department. </p>

		<p id="properties3">Mises was chief economist for the Austrian Chamber of Commerce and was an economic adviser of Engelbert Dollfuss, the austrofascist but strongly anti-Nazi Austrian Chancellor.[12] Later he was economic adviser to Otto von Habsburg, the Christian democratic politician and claimant to the throne of Austria (which had been legally abolished in 1918 following the Great War).[13] In 1934, Mises left Austria for Geneva, Switzerland, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940. </p>
