	<!-- To use an exterior file of style(most common usage of css):

		<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" > 
		It'll be a lot more easier because you can use the same style sheet on the many more webpages of that same domain -->

		<!-- Incorporated css will be restricted to one page only, the one page the has the CSS incorporated in its HTML file. In order to use that we have to use the <style></style> tag.

		<style>
			h1 {
				font-size: 200%
	
			}
		</style> -->

		<!-- The last way to use CSS is through inline CSS. Basically, the CSS will be restricted to one tag in the HTML file. A good example would be:
		 <h1 style="color:red"> Page tittle </h1>-->

		 <!-- 
		 This is a CSS bracket connected to a class: 
			
		 .classname{
	
		 } 


		 -->

		 <!-- This is a CSS bracket connected to multiple html tags(in this case the tags ul, li and a will have its letters in a different color):
		 ul, li, a{
			color: lime;
		 } 
		 -->

		 <!-- This is a CSS bracket connected to an HTML tag through ID:
		 #idname {
	
		 } 
		 -->

		 <!-- The main difference between the usage of ID and CLASS specs is that id is unique while class can be applied to a group of tags -->

		 <!-- This CSS bracket is only applied to a certain combination of tags(<div><p>Only this kinda of text will have its color changed to lime</p></div>):
		 	div p{
				color: lime;
		 	}
		 -->

		 <!-- This CSS bracket has a very special use, the first type of tag will serve as a reference to the properties of the bracket since only the first element right after it will get the specified changes(only the first <a></a> tag after a <h1></h1> tag will have its letters changed):

		 	h1+a{
		 		color: lime;
		 	}

		 -->

		 <!--
		 	These two tags are perfectly possible:
			
			<label for="presshere">This button has two classes and an id: </label>
		 	<input id="presshere" class="red button" type="submit" value="Enter">  
		 -->

		 <!--
		 A possible styling bracket would be:

		 #highlight div p a {
			color: orange;
		 } 

		 In this case the web browser will first locate in the code the many <a></a> tags of your documents to then locate which one of these tags are <p><a></a></p> tags. After that, the web browser will locate which one of these <p><a></a></p> tags are 
		 <div><p><a></a></p></div>. At last, the browser shall look for the name of the id in the universe of <div><p><a></a></p></div> tags(it'll look for a <div><p><a id="highligh"></a></p></div>).
		 -->

		 <!-- It is not strange to find multiple types of CSS linked in a same HTML file. The order in which a browser reads these multiple types of CSS linking is:

		 1) external CSS  [<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" > ]

		 2) internal CSS  
		 [		<style>
			h1 {
				font-size: 200%
	
			}
		</style> --]

		 3) internal and HTML incorporated CSS [ <h1 style="color:red"> Page tittle </h1> ]


		 One more reason to always avoid internal incorporated CSS.
