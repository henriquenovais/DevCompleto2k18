	<!-- To use an exterior file of style(most common usage of css):

		<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" > 
		It'll be a lot more easier because you can use the same style sheet on the many more webpages of that same domain -->

		<!-- Incorporated css will be restricted to one page only, the one page the has the CSS incorporated in its HTML file. In order to use that we have to use the <style></style> tag.

		<style>
			h1 {
				font-size: 200%
	
			}
		</style> -->

		<!-- The last way to use CSS is through inline CSS. Basically, the CSS will be restricted to one tag in the HTML file. A good example would be:
		 <h1 style="color:red"> Page tittle </h1>-->
	<style type="text/css">
		
	</style>
