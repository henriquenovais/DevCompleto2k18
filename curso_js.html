		Putting javascript in a html file is very simmilar to CSS.

		 The most common and efficient way to do so is through another  javascript file, to do so the tag will be:
		 <script type="text/javascript" src="arquivo.js"></scrip>

		 The second most common and efficient way is to write:

		 <script type="text/javascript">
			//javascript code goes here!
		 <scrip> 

		The third and least efficient way is to do so is through inline javascript. It's very rare and not recommended even though it is practical.

		 /* 

		 Another fundamental topic is about the adequate positioning of the <script><scrip> tag in the HTML file. There are two optimal positioning places: the first is before the closing body tag(</body>) and the second is before the closing head tag(</head>).

		/* In the following example, it is possible to see two variables:

			var global;

			function useGlobalVariable(){

				var local;
				local = 500;
				global = 700;
			}

			alert(global);
			alert(local);

			When a variable is declared outsite of a function, it is considered by the compiler as a global variable. "alert(global);" in this case will be able to display the value of the global variable as 700 - even without calling the function - because global is a global variable whereas "alert(local);" will display local's value as 0 even though the function useGlobalVariable assigns it the value of 500(that happens because local is a local variable).

			This is a very important distinction for larger pieces of code.

		//Arrays

		console.log("Now, the array lost one element at the start of it:  " + array1);

		console.log("Index of the element 400 is:" + search);

		array1.sort(); 

		console.log("The variable array1 is now sorted:" + array1);

		//It is fundamental to note that a string is basically a vector of characters. Each character has an index.
		var string = "This is a string";


		//string.substr is a method to separate the string in smaller strings.

		//string.charAt is able to show which character ocupies a certain index in the string

		//Split is an important method for strings because it allows the programmer to "break" the string in an array of multiple strings according to one character that will be considerer as the referential for the string separation
		//In this case, our string_array has "This is a string" and through string.split(" "); the character " " will be the splitting reference.
		//The output in this case will be an array of four indexes and each will be composed by: "This", "is", "a" and "string".
		string_array = string.split(" ");
		console.log("The string has been split into: " + string_array);

		string_array = string;

		//Through the same method, string.split("character"); it is even possible to specify which one of the splitted parts will be useful for the programmer.

		string_array = string.split(" ")[0];
		console.log("The first splitted string is: " + string_array);

		string = string.toLowerCase();

		console.log(string);

		string = string.toUpperCase();

		console.log(string);

		var a_date = new Date();

		console.log(a_date.getFullYear());
		//January is month index 0 and this will apply to all other months. For example, index 3 is April.
		console.log(a_date.getMonth());
		var birth_date = new Date(1995,3,20); // birth_date now has the value of a specific date.
		console.log(birth_date.getDay());
