		Putting javascript in a html file is very simmilar to CSS.

		 The most common and efficient way to do so is through another  javascript file, to do so the tag will be:
		 <script type="text/javascript" src="arquivo.js"></scrip>

		 The second most common and efficient way is to write:

		 <script type="text/javascript">
			//javascript code goes here!
		 <scrip> 

		The third and least efficient way is to do so is through inline javascript. It's very rare and not recommended even though it is practical.

		 /* 

		 Another fundamental topic is about the adequate positioning of the <script><scrip> tag in the HTML file. There are two optimal positioning places: the first is before the closing body tag(</body>) and the second is before the closing head tag(</head>).

			var result = monthly_income/work_days;
			//(variable).toFixed(number) will display  
			return (result).toFixed(2);
			// Math.ceil to do an aproximation such as: 67.777777777 = 68

		/* In the following example, it is possible to see two variables:

			var global;

			function useGlobalVariable(){

				var local;
				local = 500;
				global = 700;
			}

			alert(global);
			alert(local);

			When a variable is declared outsite of a function, it is considered by the compiler as a global variable. "alert(global);" in this case will be able to display the value of the global variable as 700 - even without calling the function - because global is a global variable whereas "alert(local);" will display local's value as 0 even though the function useGlobalVariable assigns it the value of 500(that happens because local is a local variable).

			This is a very important distinction for larger pieces of code.
